# NBA-Classification-Player-Impact

This is repository that uses R to analyze NBA players impact based on certain statistics that we found were helpful.
We used tree-based models, SVM, shrinkage, and KNN in R to rank NBA player’s
annual output

From this, we predicted season awards, such as Most Valuable Player, based on our ranking and discovered certain biases
from the media’s award selections

To run this project, use RStudio and run the markdown file
